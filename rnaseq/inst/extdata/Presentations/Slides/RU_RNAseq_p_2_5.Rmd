## The data.

In this session we will be reviewing data from Christina Leslie's lab at MSKCC on T-Reg cells and activated T-Reg cells. T-Reg data can be found on the Encode portal [here](https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR486LMB/) and activated T-Reg data [here](https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR726DNP/)

I have aligned all FQ to BAM and counted in genes and exons using Rsubread and summariseOverlaps() and then analysed this data for expression changes using DESeq2.

---
## The data.

All Gene and Exon counts can be found as .RData obects in **Data** directory

- Counts in genes can be found at - **Data/GeneCounts.RData**
- Counts in disjoint exons can be found at - **Data/ExonCounts.RData**

- Salmon transcript quantification output directories can be found under - **Data/Salmon/**

---
## The data.

You can find an excel file of differential expression analysis for this comparison in the **Data** directory.

- CSV file of differential expression results for activated versus resting T-cells - **Data/Group_Activated_minus_Resting.csv**.


---
## What we will cover.

In our last session we will looked at how we can identiy changes in gene expression from two separate methods to gene expression estimates and looked a little at the output from comparing differential expression levels using DESeq2

In this session we will explore a few ways we can evaluate any enrichment for functionally related genes from our differential expression analysis. 

**Are genes related to "immune reponse" enriched in my set of significantly upregulated gene.**

**Do "cell cycle" genes change more between conditions then other genes**

---
## What We test and how we test?

There are many options available to us for both functions/pathways/categories **(Gene set)** we will test and the methods we can use to test these gene sets for enrichment in our analysis **(Gene set Enrichment Analysis)**.

- **Geneset** - A named collection of genes.
- **Gene Set enrichment Analysis - GSA** - Broad term for correlating a set of genes with a condition/phenotype.
- **Gene Set Enrichment Analysis - GSEA** - Broad's term for correlating a set of genes with a condition/phenotype.

---
## Gene sets

We have already reviewed how we can get information on genes using the **Org.db** packages in our previous sessions.

We can also have access to information on the genesets themselves using some of the bioconductor resources including **GO.db**, **KEGG.db**, **reactome.db** packages.

Another rich source of gene sets can be found at the Molecular Signature DataBase (MSigDB) database.

---
## GSEA and MSigDB

The GSEA software and MSigDB gene set collections can be found at the [Broad's site](http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp)


---
## MSigDB

We have access to Human gene sets containing information on.

* H	- hallmark gene sets
* C1	- positional gene sets
* C2	- curated gene sets
* C3	- motif gene sets
* C4	- computational gene sets
* C5	- GO gene sets
* C6	- oncogenic gene sets 
* C7	- immunologic gene sets

---
## MSigDB

The **gmt** (gene matrix transposed) is a GSEA specific which is easy to edit and spreadsheet programs.

It contains tab separated space with lines containing gene sets of differing sizes.

---
## GSEAbase

We can access gene sets in gmt format using the GSEABase package.

```{r ,gseabase}
library(GSEABase)
```

---
## Reading gmt

The GSEABase function **getGmt** allows us to import our gmt formated gene set collection into a **GeneSetCollection** object.

```{r, Readinggmt}
hallMarks <- getGmt("~/Downloads/h.all.v6.2.symbols.gmt.txt")
hallMarks
```


---
## GeneSetCollection

The GeneSetCollection object can be subset as a list.

```{r, GeneSetCollection}
hallMarks[1]
hallMarks[[1]]
```

---
## GeneSetCollection

We can access the names of gene sets using the **names()** accessor

```{r, names}
names(hallMarks)
```

---
## GeneSetCollection as a list

The geneIDs() function returns a list named by gene set with each named element containing the genes (their IDS) contained within that set.

```{r, geneIDs}
geneIds(hallMarks)[1:3]
```

---

## Human to mouse genesets

To make use of human genesets in mouse we can either

- Translate relevant set to mouse orthologue names.
- Use an alternative mouse specific set.

---

## gskb 

The **gskb** package holds many pathways and gene sets for mouse genome equivalent to MSigDB.

First we can load the package.

```{r, gskb}
library(gskb)
```

---

## gskb datasets

The **gskb** package contains 7 collections of genes.

* mm_GO - gene sets from Gene Ontology for mouse (Mus musculus)
* mm_location - Gene sets based on chromosomal location
* mm_metabolic - metabolic pathways
* mm_miRNA - Target genes of microRNAs, predicted or experimentally verified
* mm_pathway - Currated pathways
* mm_TF - Transcription factor target genes.
* mm_other - Everything else.

---

## Accessing gskb data.

We access gskb datasets by using the **data()** function to load into memory the gene set collection of interest.
```{r, data}
data(mm_miRNA)
names(mm_miRNA)[1:2]
mm_miRNA[1]
```

---

## Translating to human

We could translate our human MSigDB collection to mouse geneset and throw away terms specific to human (such as chromosome location).

Thank fully someone already did just this for us.

We can find mouse translations from human [here](http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/MSigDB/) and we can load the RData object directly into our session.

```{r, wehi}
load("~/Downloads/mouse_H_v5p2.rdata")
class(Mm.H)
```

---

## Translating to human

This contains a named list genesets converted to mouse Entrez IDs.

```{r, wehi2}
Mm.H
```

---
## List to GeneSetCollection

We can convert the list to a GeneSetCollection to take advantage of GSEABase functionality.

We must first create a list of **GeneSet** objects using **GeneSet()** constructor and then create **GeneSetCollection** from list usin **GeneSetCollection** constructor.

```{r, wehi3}
myGeneSetList <- list()
for(i in 1:length(Mm.H)){
  myGeneSetList[[i]] <- GeneSet(Mm.H[[i]],setName=names(Mm.H)[i])
}
myGeneSetCollection <- GeneSetCollection(myGeneSetList)
myGeneSetCollection
```

---

## GeneSetCollection to gmt

We can now use the toGmt function to export our GeneSetCollection to gmt formated file for use in other software.

```{r, wehi4}
toGmt(myGeneSetCollection,
      con="mouse_Hallmarks.gmt")
```

---

## Testing genesets.

We will review two different methods to identify functional groups associated with our condition of interest.

* The first method will test for any association of our gene set with our a group of interesting genes (differentially expressed genes).
* The second method will test for any association of our gene set with the ranking of all our genes (ranked by measure of differential expression).

---

## DE results from DESeq2.

First lets read in our differential expression results from DESeq2 analysis of activated vs resting T-cells.

```{r, deres}
Activated_minus_Resting <- read.delim(file="../../Data/Group_Activated_minus_Resting.csv",sep=",")
Activated_minus_Resting[1:3,]
```

---

## Background

All GSA methods will require us to filter to genes to those tested for differential expression. 

We will therefore filter to all genes which pass our independent filtering step from DESeq2. These will be our genes with no NA in the DESeq2 padj column

```{r, deresFilter}
Activated_minus_Resting <- Activated_minus_Resting[!is.na(Activated_minus_Resting$padj),]
Activated_minus_Resting[1:3,]

```


---
## goseq package.

We can use the goseq package to identify any functional enrichment in a set of interesting genes (i.e. differentially expressed). The goseq package requires a named vector of 1s or 0s indicating whether a gene is upregulated/downregulated. 

Here we define a set of genes significantly upregulated in Activated vs Naive T-reg cells (padj <0 05 and log2FC > 1).

```{r func,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,cache=TRUE,dependson="anno2"}
UpInAct <- Activated_minus_Resting$padj < 0.05 & 
             Activated_minus_Resting$log2FoldChange > 0
UpInAct <- as.integer(UpInAct)
names(UpInAct) <- Activated_minus_Resting$ENTREZID
UpInAct[1:4]
table(UpInAct)
```


---
## Functional Enrichment analysis.

The **goseq** package is specifically designed to account for potential length biases in differential expression analysis and so can remove any artefactual enrichment for long and short genes.

The **nullp** function assess any biases by evaluating the relationship between differential expression and length. 

```{r func1,eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE,cache=FALSE,dependson="func"}
library(goseq)
pwf = nullp(UpInAct, "mm10", "knownGene", plot.fit = TRUE)
```

<div align="center">
<img src="imgs/fir.png" alt="igv" height="200" width="500">
</div>
---
## Functional Enrichment analysis.

Having corrected for any bias we can now use the **goseq** function to for enrichment of GO or KEGG terms.

We must specify the genome build and ID we are using (here matching our TxDb.UCSC.**mm10**.**knownGene**.db) and the categories we wish to test (GO:BP,GO:MF,GO:CC,KEGG). 

Here we identify the top enriched functional terms in GO biological processes.
```{r funca,eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,cache=TRUE,include=FALSE}
load(file="../../Data/fit.RData")
```

```{r func2,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,cache=TRUE,dependson="funca",warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
GO_UpInAct <- goseq(pwf,"mm10","knownGene",
                       test.cats=c("GO:BP"))
GO_UpInAct[1:3,]
```

---
## Retrieving function groups.

We can retrieve the genes in the **immune response (GO:0006955)** functional group using the **select** and the **org.Mm.eg.db** object.

We then filter our DE table and write to file.

```{r func3,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,cache=TRUE,dependson="funca",warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(org.Mm.eg.db)
ImmuneResponseGenes <- select(org.Mm.eg.db,keytype = "GOALL",
                              keys = "GO:0006955",columns = "ENTREZID")
ImmuneResponseGenes

```

---
## Retrieving function groups.

We can retrieve the genes in the **immune response (GO:0006955)** functional group using the **select** and the **org.Mm.eg.db** object.


```{r func4,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,cache=TRUE,dependson="func3",warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
IRG_Entrez <- unique(Activated_minus_Resting$ENTREZID)
IRG_Res <-  Activated_minus_Resting[Activated_minus_Resting$ENTREZID %in% IRG_Entrez,]
write.table(IRG_Res,
            file="ImmuneResponseGeneTable.csv",sep=",",
            row.names = FALSE)
IRG_Res[1:3,]
```

---

## GSEA

Another popular method for differential expression analysis is the Broad's GSEA method.

GSEA tests whether our gene set is correlated with the ranking of genes by our differential expression analysis metric using a modified KS-test.

![](imgs/GSEA.jpg)

---

## GSEA inputs

We have already seen how we can write gene set collections as gmt format files. The gmt format is the standard input format for GSEA gene sets.

We will also need to produce a ranked table of gene ids and write to a **rnk** format file. Here will rank by **stat** column to give sensible measure of differential expression. We could also use **log2FoldChange** column if we have modified log2 fold changes using **lfsShrink()** function.

```{r, myRNK}

forRNK <- data.frame(Activated_minus_Resting$ENTREZID,
                     Activated_minus_Resting$stat)

forRNK[1:3,]
```

---

## rnk file

We can now write our results to a rnk file for use within GSEA.

```{r, myRNKwrite}

write.table(forRNK,
            file="Activated_minus_Resting.rnk",
            sep="\t",
            col.names = FALSE,
            row.names = FALSE)
```

---

## fgsea

The **fgsea** package provides access to GSEA method within the R framework.

Once installed we can load library in standard way.

```{r, fgsea}
library(fgsea)
```

---

## fgsea

We can make use of gmt files directly by using the **gmtPathways()** function to read our previous created gmt file of mouse translated gene sets.

```{r, gmtPathways}
mouse_Hallmarks <- gmtPathways("mouse_Hallmarks.gmt")
class(mouse_Hallmarks)
names(mouse_Hallmarks)
```

---

## fgsea

Similar to goseq package we need to provide a vector of our ranking metric named by gene id. We can create this from our **rnk** file.

```{r, rnkForR}
Act_minus_Rest_rnk <- read.delim("Activated_minus_Resting.rnk",sep="\t",
                                 h=FALSE,row.names = 1)
Act_minus_Rest_gsea <- Act_minus_Rest_rnk[,1]
names(Act_minus_Rest_gsea) <- rownames(Act_minus_Rest_rnk)
Act_minus_Rest_gsea[1:3]
```

---

## fgsea

The **fgsea()** functions requires our gene sets, named vector of ranking metric, the minimum and maximum sizes of gene sets to be tested (to **minSize** and **maxSize** parameters respectively) and the number of perumtations to run (**nperm** parameter).

```{r, fgsefun}

Act_minus_Rest_gseaRes <- fgsea(mouse_Hallmarks, 
                                Act_minus_Rest_gsea, 
                                minSize=15, maxSize=500, nperm=1000)
Act_minus_Rest_gseaRes <- Act_minus_Rest_gseaRes[order(Act_minus_Rest_gseaRes$NES,
                                                       decreasing = T),]
Act_minus_Rest_gseaRes[1:2,]
```

---

## fgsea

We can extract leading edge genes from **leadingEdge** column as a list.

```{r, fgsefunews}
Act_minus_Rest_gseaRes$leadingEdge
```

---

## fgsea

We can use these leading edge genes to select genes strongl;y correlated with our condition and within an enriched gene set.

```{r, fgsefuneds}
INTERFERON_Response_LE <- Act_minus_Rest_gseaRes$leadingEdge[[1]]
IR_LE <- Activated_minus_Resting[Activated_minus_Resting$ENTREZID %in% INTERFERON_Response_LE,]
IR_LE[1:2,]
```


---
## GSEA plots

We can also produce a GSEA style plot to visualise our enrichment in a pathway of interest using the **plotEnrichment()** function.
We simply provide the pathway to plot and the ranking we used in test.

```{r, plotEnrichment}
plotEnrichment(mouse_Hallmarks[["HALLMARK_INTERFERON_GAMMA_RESPONSE"]],
               Act_minus_Rest_gsea)
```
